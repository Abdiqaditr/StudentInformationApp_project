This project involves developing an Android application to manage student information with data entry and display functionalities. The app's main activity hosts two fragments: one for entering student details and another for displaying the list of students. Key features include smooth navigation between fragments, responsive design with scrollable layouts, and data persistence using ViewModel to handle configuration changes, such as screen rotations, without data loss. The project is structured to ensure ease of use, scalable architecture, and efficient data management.
